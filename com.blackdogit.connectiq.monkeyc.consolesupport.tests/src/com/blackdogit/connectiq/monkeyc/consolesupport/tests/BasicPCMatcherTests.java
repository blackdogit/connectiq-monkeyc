 * Tests of PCMatcher.

 * As most of the interfaces are private, this is basically reduced to a sort of integration test:
 * <ul>
 * <li>create project with source and debug file</li>
 * <li>create console with correct type</li>
 * <li>add test to console</li>
 * <li>find hyperlink and press it</li>
 * <li>check the correct editor is opened and line is correct</li>
 * </ul>
